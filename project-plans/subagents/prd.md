# Subagents for LLxprt - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing subagents in LLxprt Code, enabling the creation of specialized AI agents that can work on specific tasks while keeping the main agent's context clean and organized. This feature enhances LLxprt's capabilities for complex, multi-step tasks by breaking them down into manageable parts that can be delegated to specialized agents.

## 2. Product Overview

Subagents in LLxprt are specialized AI instances that:
- Are assigned specific subsets of work from the main agent's task list
- Operate with isolated contexts to prevent context pollution
- Can use different model configurations through profile references
- Report progress and results through the existing Todo system
- Enable both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (background) execution

## 3. Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: Developers using LLxprt for complex coding tasks
- **Secondary Users**: AI agents (coordinators) managing subagents for multi-step workflows
- **System Administrators**: Creating and maintaining subagent configurations and profiles
