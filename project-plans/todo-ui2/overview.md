# Todo UI Enhancement Remediation Plan

## Purpose

This document outlines the remediation plan for the Todo UI Enhancement feature that was implemented but never integrated into the application. The feature exists as isolated components that pass unit tests but provide zero user value because they're never rendered to users.

## Failure Analysis

The original implementation followed all planned steps but stopped exactly at the integration boundary:

1. ✅ TodoDisplay component created with comprehensive tests
2. ✅ Extended schemas implemented with proper validation
3. ✅ Tools updated to support new data structures
4. ❌ TodoProvider never implemented with state management
5. ❌ TodoContext never wrapped around the application
6. ❌ TodoDisplay never rendered in App.tsx
7. ❌ No data flow mechanism between tools and UI

This resulted in 35+ hours of development effort delivering 0% user value.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Pattern**: Component-based architecture with React/Ink for UI rendering
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, React, Ink, Zod for schema validation
- **Data Flow**: Event-driven data flow from tools to UI component through React context
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Existing TodoWrite and TodoRead tools in `packages/core/src/tools/`
  - CLI application in `packages/cli/src/`
  - TodoStore for persistence in `packages/core/src/tools/todo-store.ts`

## Remediation Approach

This plan follows an agentic implementation approach where each phase builds upon verified previous work:

1. **TodoProvider Implementation** - Create state management layer that connects to TodoStore
2. **App Integration** - Wire TodoProvider into application and conditionally render TodoDisplay
3. **Event System** - Connect TodoWrite executions to UI updates
4. **Verification** - End-to-end testing of the complete flow

## Project Structure

```
packages/
  cli/
    src/
      ui/
        components/
          TodoDisplay.tsx        # Existing component to be integrated
        contexts/
          TodoContext.tsx        # Existing context definition
          TodoProvider.tsx       # NEW - State management provider
        App.tsx                  # Modified to integrate provider and component
  core/
    src/
      tools/
        todo-write.ts            # Modified to emit events
        todo-read.ts             # Existing functionality
        todo-store.ts            # Existing functionality
        todo-schemas.ts          # Existing extended schemas
```

## Success Criteria

- Users see TodoDisplay with hierarchical task structure in interactive mode
- Subtasks render indented with • bullet markers
- Tool calls render indented with ↳ arrow markers
- UI automatically updates when TodoWrite executes
- Non-interactive mode continues to show simplified Markdown
- All existing functionality preserved
- Performance requirements met (<100ms updates for up to 50 tasks)
- Zero breaking changes to existing APIs
