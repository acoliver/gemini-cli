# App Integration Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the App integration was completed correctly:

1. TodoProvider integrated into AppWrapper
2. TodoDisplay conditionally rendered
3. Proper placement in render tree
4. Context correctly used in App component
5. Follows clean code practices

## Verification Steps

### 1. Provider Integration Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoProvider is integrated into AppWrapper
grep -q "TodoProvider" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: TodoProvider integrated" || echo "FAIL: TodoProvider not integrated"
```

### 2. TodoDisplay Rendering Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoDisplay is conditionally rendered
grep -q "TodoDisplay" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: TodoDisplay found" || echo "FAIL: TodoDisplay not found"
```

### 3. Context Usage Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoContext is used in App component
grep -q "useTodoContext\|TodoContext" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: TodoContext usage found" || echo "FAIL: TodoContext usage not found"
```

### 4. Render Tree Placement Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoDisplay is placed appropriately in render tree
# This would require manual verification by inspecting the code
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check TodoDisplay placement in render tree"
```

### 5. Session/Agent Context Verification

```bash
# Check that session and agent IDs are passed to TodoProvider
grep -q "sessionId.*agentId" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: Session/agent context handled" || echo "CHECK: Verify session/agent context"
```

### 6. TypeScript and Linting Verification

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode
npx tsc --noEmit --strict packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx

# Check for absence of comments (self-documenting code)
grep -E "^\s*//" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "WARNING: Comments found in code" || echo "PASS: No comments in code"
```

### 7. Existing Functionality Verification

```bash
# Ensure existing functionality is preserved
# This would require manual testing
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Test that existing functionality is preserved"
```

## Success Criteria

- TodoProvider integrated into AppWrapper
- TodoDisplay conditionally rendered
- Proper placement in render tree
- Context correctly used in App component
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- All code compiles with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors
- Self-documenting code (no comments)
