# Todo UI Remediation Pseudocode Phase

## Overview

This phase involves creating detailed pseudocode for each component based on the specification and domain analysis. The pseudocode will guide the implementation without including actual TypeScript code.

## Pseudocode Requirements

- Pseudocode must cover all requirements from specification
- No actual implementation code should be written
- Clear algorithm documentation is required
- All error paths must be defined
- Function signatures with types should be included
- Data transformations should be documented

## Components to Create Pseudocode For

### 1. TodoProvider
- Provider structure and props
- State management
- Data loading and persistence
- Event handling
- Error handling

### 2. App Integration
- AppWrapper modification
- TodoDisplay conditional rendering
- Context usage in app
- Proper placement in render tree

### 3. Event System
- Event emitter structure
- Event emission from TodoWrite
- Event listening in TodoProvider
- Error handling in event system

## Success Criteria

- Pseudocode covers all requirements
- No actual implementation code
- Clear algorithm documentation
- All error paths defined
- Function signatures with types included
- Data transformations documented
