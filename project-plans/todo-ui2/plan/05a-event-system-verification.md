# Event System Implementation Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the event system implementation was completed correctly:

1. Event emitter properly implemented
2. TodoWrite emits events in interactive mode
3. TodoProvider listens for and processes events
4. Event data correctly structured
5. Error handling in event system
6. Follows clean code practices

## Verification Steps

### 1. Event Emitter Verification

```bash
# Check that event emitter is properly implemented
grep -q "emit\|on\|off" packages/core/src/tools/todo-event-emitter.ts && \
  echo "PASS: Event emitter methods found" || echo "FAIL: Event emitter methods missing"
```

### 2. TodoWrite Event Emission Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoWrite emits events in interactive mode
grep -q "eventEmitter.emit\|todoUpdated" packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts && \
  echo "PASS: Event emission found" || echo "FAIL: Event emission missing"
```

### 3. TodoProvider Event Listening Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoProvider listens for events
grep -q "eventEmitter.on\|todoUpdated" packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/TodoProvider.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: Event listening found" || echo "FAIL: Event listening missing"
```

### 4. Event Data Structure Verification

```bash
# Check that event data is correctly structured
# This would require manual verification by inspecting the code
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check event data structure"
```

### 5. Error Handling Verification

```bash
# Check that event system has error handling
grep -q "catch\|try" packages/core/src/tools/todo-event-emitter.ts && \
  echo "PASS: Error handling found" || echo "CHECK: Verify error handling"
```

### 6. TypeScript and Linting Verification

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode
npx tsc --noEmit --strict packages/core/src/tools/todo-event-emitter.ts
npx tsc --noEmit --strict packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/TodoProvider.tsx

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint packages/core/src/tools/todo-event-emitter.ts
npm run lint packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/TodoProvider.tsx

# Check for absence of comments (self-documenting code)
grep -E "^\s*//" packages/core/src/tools/todo-event-emitter.ts && \
  echo "WARNING: Comments found in code" || echo "PASS: No comments in code"
```

### 7. Integration Testing Verification

```bash
# Test that events properly connect TodoWrite to TodoProvider
# This would require manual testing
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Test event system integration"
```

## Success Criteria

- TodoWrite emits events in interactive mode
- TodoProvider listens for and processes events
- Event data correctly structured
- Error handling in event system
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- All code compiles with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors
- Self-documenting code (no comments)
