# Event System Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement the event system to connect TodoWrite tool executions to UI updates. This will enable automatic refresh of the TODO display when todos change.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing, review the following documents:
- `project-plans/todo-ui2/prd.md` - Feature specification with requirements
- `project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/pseudocode/component-event-system.md` - Event system pseudocode
- `packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts` - Tool to be modified for event emission
- `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/TodoProvider.tsx` - Component to listen for events
- `docs/RULES.md` - Development guidelines for clean code practices

## Implementation Requirements

1. Implement event emitter for todo updates
2. Modify TodoWrite to emit events in interactive mode
3. Modify TodoProvider to listen for events
4. Ensure proper event data structure
5. Handle event errors appropriately
6. Follow clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
7. Use TypeScript strict mode
8. Work with immutable data only

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Event Emitter Implementation

1. Create TodoEventEmitter class
2. Implement emit, on, and off methods
3. Ensure thread-safe event handling
4. Handle error propagation in event listeners

### 2. TodoWrite Modification

1. Import event emitter
2. Modify execute method to emit events in interactive mode
3. Ensure event includes session and agent IDs
4. Handle event emission errors

### 3. TodoProvider Modification

1. Import event emitter
2. Modify provider to listen for events
3. Verify events are for correct session/agent
4. Trigger refresh when relevant events received
5. Handle event listener cleanup

### 4. Event Data Structure

1. Define TodoUpdateEvent interface
2. Ensure event includes all necessary data
3. Validate event data before processing

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- All code must compile with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors or warnings
- Follow naming conventions from `docs/RULES.md`
- Self-documenting function and variable names
- No comments in code

### Execution Quality
- Events properly emitted by TodoWrite
- Events properly received by TodoProvider
- Event data correctly structured
- Error handling in event system
- No console.log statements or debug code
- No TODO comments

## Success Criteria

- Event emitter properly implemented
- TodoWrite emits events in interactive mode
- TodoProvider listens for and processes events
- Event data correctly structured
- Error handling in event system
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New functionality achieves at least 80% test coverage
- No performance degradation in CLI operations
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- All code compiles with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors
