# Todo UI Remediation Analysis Phase

## Overview

This phase involves detailed domain analysis based on the feature specification. The goal is to understand entity relationships, state transitions, business rules, edge cases, and error scenarios for the remediation effort.

Review the following documents before beginning:
- `project-plans/todo-ui2/prd.md` - Feature specification with requirements
- `project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/pseudocode/component-todo-provider.md` - Provider pseudocode for context

## Analysis Requirements

- All REQ tags from specification must be addressed
- No implementation details should be included
- Complete edge case coverage is required
- Clear business rule definitions must be provided

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Entity Relationships

Analyze and document the relationships between:
- Todo entities
- Subtask entities
- ToolCall entities
- TodoStore entities
- TodoProvider entities
- Session/Agent context

### 2. State Transitions

Document the state transitions for:
- Todo status (pending, in_progress, completed)
- UI display states (empty, loading, rendering, updating)
- Provider states (initializing, loaded, error)

### 3. Business Rules

Define all business rules including:
- Task ordering requirements
- Status marker conventions
- Indentation rules
- Display refresh behavior
- Output control rules
- Tool call association rules
- Event propagation rules

### 4. Edge Cases

Identify and document edge cases such as:
- Empty todo list handling
- Tasks without subtasks
- Subtasks without tool calls
- Very long task content
- Large number of tasks
- Malformed data
- Concurrent updates
- Provider initialization failures
- Event system failures

### 5. Error Scenarios

Document potential error scenarios including:
- Data retrieval failures
- Data persistence failures
- UI rendering failures
- Context update failures
- Terminal compatibility issues
- Performance degradation
- Provider initialization failures
- Event system failures

### 6. Integration Points

Analyze integration points with:
- Todo tools (TodoWrite, TodoRead)
- TodoStore for persistence
- App state management
- CLI application
- Event system

## Success Criteria

- Complete domain model documented in analysis/domain-model.md
- All REQ tags addressed
- No implementation details included
- Edge cases fully covered
- Business rules clearly defined
- Error scenarios documented
- Integration points analyzed
