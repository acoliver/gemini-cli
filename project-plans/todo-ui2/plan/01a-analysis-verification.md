# Todo UI Remediation Analysis Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the domain analysis was completed correctly according to the PLAN.md guidelines:

1. All REQ tags from specification are addressed
2. No implementation details are included
3. Complete edge case coverage is provided
4. Clear business rule definitions are included
5. Error scenarios are documented
6. Integration points are analyzed

## Verification Steps

### 1. REQ Tag Verification

```bash
# Extract REQ tags from specification
SPEC_REQS=$(grep -o "REQ-[0-9.]*" project-plans/todo-ui2/prd.md | sort -u)

# Check that each REQ tag is addressed in analysis
for req in $SPEC_REQS; do
  grep -q "$req" project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/domain-model.md || \
    echo "MISSING: REQ tag $req not addressed in analysis"
done
```

### 2. Implementation Detail Verification

```bash
# Check that analysis contains no implementation details
# Look for code-like patterns, algorithm descriptions, or implementation specifics
grep -E "(function|class|interface|implements|extends|return|throw|if|for|while)" \
  project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/domain-model.md && \
  echo "WARNING: Possible implementation details found in analysis" || \
  echo "PASS: No implementation details found"
```

### 3. Edge Case Coverage Verification

```bash
# Check that edge cases are documented
grep -q "Edge Cases" project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/domain-model.md && \
  echo "PASS: Edge cases section found" || \
  echo "MISSING: Edge cases section"
```

### 4. Business Rule Verification

```bash
# Check that business rules are defined
grep -q "Business Rules" project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/domain-model.md && \
  echo "PASS: Business rules section found" || \
  echo "MISSING: Business rules section"
```

### 5. Error Scenario Verification

```bash
# Check that error scenarios are documented
grep -q "Error Scenarios" project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/domain-model.md && \
  echo "PASS: Error scenarios section found" || \
  echo "MISSING: Error scenarios section"
```

### 6. Integration Point Verification

```bash
# Check that integration points are analyzed
grep -q "Integration Points" project-plans/todo-ui2/analysis/domain-model.md && \
  echo "PASS: Integration points section found" || \
  echo "MISSING: Integration points section"
```

## Success Criteria

- All verification steps pass
- All REQ tags addressed
- No implementation details included
- Edge cases fully covered
- Business rules clearly defined
- Error scenarios documented
- Integration points analyzed
