# Todo Tool Enhancement Project - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project enhances the existing todo tool functionality in LLXPRT to automatically capture and display tool calls subordinate to active todo items. This feature improves task tracking and provides better visibility into the execution context of each task.

## Components Implemented

### 1. TodoContextTracker Service
- Tracks which todo item is currently active in a session
- Provides methods to set, get, and clear the active todo
- Manages session-specific tracking

### 2. ToolCallTrackerService
- Records tool calls and associates them with active todos
- Uses TodoContextTracker to determine the active todo
- Persists tool calls with their associated todos in the JSON store

### 3. CoreToolScheduler Integration
- Modified to use ToolCallTrackerService when executing tools
- Records tool calls without interrupting normal execution flow
- Handles errors gracefully to avoid disrupting tool execution

### 4. UI Component Updates
- Updated TodoDisplay component to show tool calls associated with todos
- Renders tool calls directly under their associated todos
- Maintains existing formatting for subtask tool calls

### 5. Tool Render Suppression
- Added configuration option to suppress normal tool call rendering when in todo mode
- Created ToolRenderSuppressionHook to determine when to suppress rendering
- Modified ToolMessage component to conditionally render based on suppression hook

### 6. Configuration Extension
- Added new configuration option `suppressToolCallRenderInTodoMode`
- Updated Config class to support the new option
- Added getter method for accessing the setting

## Files Modified

### Core Package
1. `packages/core/src/services/todo-context-tracker.ts` - New service for tracking active todos
2. `packages/core/src/services/tool-call-tracker-service.ts` - New service for recording tool calls
3. `packages/core/src/hooks/tool-render-suppression-hook.ts` - New hook for determining render suppression
4. `packages/core/src/tools/todo-schemas.ts` - Extended schema to support direct tool calls on todos
5. `packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts` - Updated to set active todo context
6. `packages/core/src/core/coreToolScheduler.ts` - Modified to record tool calls during execution
7. `packages/core/src/config/config.ts` - Added new configuration option
8. `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Added exports for new modules
9. `packages/core/src/services/tool-call-tracker-service.test.ts` - Tests for tool call tracking
10. `packages/core/src/hooks/tool-render-suppression-hook.test.ts` - Tests for render suppression

### CLI Package
1. `packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx` - Updated to display tool calls with todos
2. `packages/cli/src/ui/components/messages/ToolMessage.tsx` - Modified to conditionally suppress rendering

## Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Tool Call Association**: When a todo is marked as "in_progress", any subsequent tool calls are automatically associated with that todo item.

2. **Subordinate Tool Call Display**: Tool calls are displayed directly under their associated todo items in the todo list display, providing context about what tools were used for each task.

3. **Conditional Rendering**: Normal tool call rendering can be suppressed when tool calls are being shown as part of a todo list, avoiding duplication.

4. **Data Persistence**: Associated tool calls are persisted with their todo items in the JSON store, maintaining state across sessions.

5. **Configuration Options**: The new behavior can be enabled/disabled through configuration settings.

## Usage

To enable the new functionality:
1. Set `suppressToolCallRenderInTodoMode` to `true` in your configuration
2. Mark a todo as `in_progress` using the todo_write tool
3. Execute tools as normal - they will be automatically associated with the active todo
4. View the todo list to see tool calls displayed subordinate to their associated todos

## Testing

- Created unit tests for ToolCallTrackerService to verify correct recording and association of tool calls
- Created unit tests for ToolRenderSuppressionHook to verify proper conditional rendering
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Backward Compatibility

- The enhancements are backward compatible
- Existing todo functionality remains unchanged when new features are disabled
- Todos without tool calls continue to work as before
- The schema extension is optional and doesn't break existing data
