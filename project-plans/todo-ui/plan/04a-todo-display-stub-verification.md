# TodoDisplay Component Stub Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the TodoDisplay component stub was implemented correctly according to the plan:

1. File exists at correct location
2. Component compiles with strict TypeScript
3. No implementation logic beyond placeholder
4. All required interfaces included
5. Maximum 100 lines total
6. Follows clean code practices

## Verification Steps

### 1. File Location Check

```bash
# Check that file exists at packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx
test -f "packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx"
```

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Check

```bash
# Check that TypeScript compiles without errors
npx tsc --noEmit --strict packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx
```

### 3. Implementation Check

```bash
# Check that component doesn't contain actual implementation logic
# Should only have placeholder rendering and throw NotYetImplemented for any complex methods
grep -E "NotYetImplemented|throw new Error\(" packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx

# Check that component is under 100 lines
wc -l packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} test {} -lt 100
```

### 4. Interface Check

```bash
# Check that all required interfaces are included
# Look for Todo, Subtask, ToolCall type definitions or imports
grep -E "(interface Todo|interface Subtask|interface ToolCall)" packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx
```

### 5. React Component Check

```bash
# Check that it's a valid React component
grep -E "import.*React|const.*TodoDisplay.*=" packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx
```

### 6. Code Quality Check

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx

# Check for absence of comments (self-documenting code)
grep -E "^\s*//" packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx && \
  echo "WARNING: Comments found in code" || echo "PASS: No comments in code"

# Check for explicit dependencies only
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check for explicit dependencies only"
```

## Success Criteria

- All verification steps pass
- File exists at correct location
- Component compiles with strict TypeScript
- No actual implementation logic beyond placeholder
- All required interfaces included
- Component under 100 lines
- Valid React component structure
- No linting errors
- Self-documenting code (no comments)
- Explicit dependencies only
