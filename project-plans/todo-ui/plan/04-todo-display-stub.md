# TodoDisplay Component Stub Implementation

## Overview

Create a minimal stub implementation of the TodoDisplay React component that compiles but doesn't yet implement the full functionality. This will form the basis for our TDD implementation cycle.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing, review the following pseudocode documents:
- `project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/component-todo-display.md` - Main component pseudocode
- `project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/component-todo-schemas.md` - Schema definitions
- `docs/RULES.md` - Development guidelines for clean code practices

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the TodoDisplay component file at `packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx`
2. Implement the basic component structure with React/Ink
3. Add proper TypeScript typing
4. Include all necessary imports
5. Make component compile with strict TypeScript

## Requirements

- Component must render something (even if just a placeholder)
- All methods should throw `new Error('NotYetImplemented')` except the main render method
- Include all TypeScript interfaces from specification
- Maximum 100 lines total
- Must compile with strict TypeScript
- Follow clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- No comments in code (self-documenting only)
- Use explicit dependencies only

## File Structure

```
packages/
  cli/
    src/
      ui/
        components/
          TodoDisplay.tsx  <- To be created
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create TodoDisplay.tsx file
2. Import necessary dependencies (React, Ink components)
3. Define component props (none, gets data from context)
4. Implement basic component structure
5. Add placeholder rendering
6. Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
7. Follow clean code practices (no comments, self-documenting names)

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- All code must compile with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors or warnings
- Follow naming conventions from `docs/RULES.md`
- Self-documenting function and variable names
- No comments in code

### Execution Quality
- Component must compile successfully
- No console.log statements or debug code
- No TODO comments

## Success Criteria

- File created at the correct location
- Component compiles with strict TypeScript
- No actual implementation logic beyond placeholder
- All required interfaces included
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- No comments in code
- No linting errors
