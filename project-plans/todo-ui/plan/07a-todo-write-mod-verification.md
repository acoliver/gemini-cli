# TodoWrite Tool Modification Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the TodoWrite tool modifications were implemented correctly:

1. Interactive mode detection works properly
2. Output suppression in interactive mode
3. Simplified output in non-interactive mode
4. Schema extensions function correctly
5. Tool call association works
6. Backward compatibility maintained
7. All existing tests still pass
8. Follows clean code practices

## Verification Steps

### 1. Mode Detection Verification

```bash
# Test that interactive mode is correctly detected
# This would involve creating test cases with context.interactiveMode set to true/false
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Test with context.interactiveMode = true and false"
```

### 2. Output Verification

```bash
# In interactive mode, output should be minimal
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts -- --testNamePattern="interactive mode"

# In non-interactive mode, output should be simplified Markdown
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts -- --testNamePattern="non-interactive mode"
```

### 3. Schema Extension Verification

```bash
# Test with extended schema (subtasks and tool calls)
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts -- --testNamePattern="extended schema"

# Test backward compatibility with old schema
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts -- --testNamePattern="backward compatibility"
```

### 4. Tool Call Association Verification

```bash
# Test that tool calls are associated with subtasks
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts -- --testNamePattern="tool call association"
```

### 5. Existing Test Verification

```bash
# Ensure all existing tests still pass
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts
```

### 6. Integration Test Verification

```bash
# Test integration with TodoStore
npm test packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.test.ts -- --testNamePattern="integration"
```

### 7. Code Quality Verification

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode
npx tsc --noEmit --strict packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts

# Check for absence of comments (self-documenting code)
grep -E "^\s*//" packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts && \
  echo "WARNING: Comments found in code" || echo "PASS: No comments in code"

# Check for immutability patterns
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check for immutable data handling"
```
