# Todo UI Enhancement Analysis Phase

## Overview

This phase involves detailed domain analysis based on the feature specification. The goal is to understand entity relationships, state transitions, business rules, edge cases, and error scenarios.

## Analysis Requirements

- All REQ tags from specification must be addressed
- No implementation details should be included
- Complete edge case coverage is required
- Clear business rule definitions must be provided

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Entity Relationships

Analyze and document the relationships between:
- Todo entities
- Subtask entities
- ToolCall entities
- TodoStore entities
- Session/Agent context

### 2. State Transitions

Document the state transitions for:
- Todo status (pending, in_progress, completed)
- UI display states (empty, rendering, updating)

### 3. Business Rules

Define all business rules including:
- Task ordering requirements
- Status marker conventions
- Indentation rules
- Display refresh behavior
- Output control rules
- Tool call association rules

### 4. Edge Cases

Identify and document edge cases such as:
- Empty todo list handling
- Tasks without subtasks
- Subtasks without tool calls
- Very long task content
- Large number of tasks
- Malformed data
- Concurrent updates

### 5. Error Scenarios

Document potential error scenarios including:
- Data retrieval failures
- Data persistence failures
- UI rendering failures
- Context update failures
- Terminal compatibility issues
- Performance degradation

### 6. Integration Points

Analyze integration points with:
- Todo tools (TodoWrite, TodoRead)
- TodoStore for persistence
- App state management
- CLI application

## Success Criteria

- Complete domain model documented
- All REQ tags addressed
- No implementation details included
- Edge cases fully covered
- Business rules clearly defined
- Error scenarios documented
