# TodoDisplay Component TDD Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create comprehensive behavioral tests for the TodoDisplay component based on the specification and requirements. These tests will drive the implementation through strict TDD.

## Prerequisites

Before creating tests, review the following documents:
- `project-plans/todo-ui/specification.md` - Feature specification with requirements
- `project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/component-todo-display.md` - Component pseudocode
- `project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/component-todo-schemas.md` - Schema definitions
- `docs/RULES.md` - Development guidelines for clean code practices

## Test Requirements

Create 15-20 behavioral tests covering:

1. Input → Output transformations for each requirement
2. State changes and side effects
3. Error conditions with specific error types/messages
4. Integration between components (real, not mocked)
5. Performance assertions if specified

## Test Structure

Each test must have Behavior-Driven comment:
```typescript
/**
 * @requirement REQ-001
 * @scenario Valid todo list with multiple tasks
 * @given Array of todo items with different statuses
 * @when TodoDisplay component is rendered
 * @then Returns formatted string with tasks in temporal order
 * @and Status markers are correctly applied
 */
```

## Critical Test Principles

### Behavioral Not Structural
- Test actual behavior with real data flows
- NEVER test mock calls or internal implementation
- Each test must transform INPUT → OUTPUT based on requirements
- Tests must have Behavior-Driven comments with @requirement tags

### Tests Must Initially Fail
- All tests must fail with NotYetImplemented before implementation
- Never write tests that pass with empty implementations
- Each test validates specific requirement fulfillment

### No Reverse Tests
- NEVER test for failure conditions only
- Avoid tests like "expect(() => fn()).not.toThrow()"
- Every test must validate positive behavior

### Requirements-Driven
- Each test directly linked to specific REQ tags from PRD
- Test scenarios must map to documented requirements
- No tests without explicit requirement coverage

### Clean Code Compliance
- Follow guidelines in `docs/RULES.md`
- No implementation details in tests
- Self-documenting test names
- One behavior assertion per test
- Explicit dependencies only

## Forbidden Patterns

- No tests that just verify mocks were called
- No tests that only check object structure exists
- No tests that pass with empty implementations
- No tests verifying mock configurations
- No reverse tests (testing for failures only)
- No structural tests (testing object shapes only)
- No type assertions or `any` types
- No mutations of data structures
- No comments in test code

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Rendering Tests

1. Empty todo list displays appropriate message [REQ-009]
2. Single task with no subtasks renders correctly [REQ-001, REQ-002]
3. Multiple tasks render in temporal order [REQ-001]
4. Completed tasks show correct marker (- [x]) [REQ-002.1]
5. Pending tasks show correct marker (- [ ]) [REQ-002.2]
6. In-progress tasks show correct marker (- [→]) [REQ-002.3]

### 2. Task Highlighting Tests

7. Current task is bolded [REQ-003.1]
8. Current task has "← current task" indicator [REQ-003.2]
9. Non-current tasks are not bolded [REQ-003.1]

### 3. Subtask Rendering Tests

10. Tasks with subtasks render subtasks indented with • [REQ-004]
11. Tasks without subtasks render without extra indentation [REQ-004]
12. Multiple subtasks render correctly [REQ-004]

### 4. Tool Call Rendering Tests

13. Subtasks with tool calls render tool calls indented with ↳ [REQ-005]
14. Subtasks without tool calls render without tool call indentation [REQ-005]
15. Tool call parameters are formatted correctly [REQ-005]

### 5. Edge Case Tests

16. Very long task content handles appropriately [REQ-025]
17. Tasks with special characters render correctly [REQ-023]
18. Malformed data is handled gracefully [REQ-022]

### 6. Integration Tests

19. Component integrates with TodoContext [REQ-011]
20. Component re-renders when context updates [REQ-008]

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- All tests must compile with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors or warnings
- Follow naming conventions from `docs/RULES.md`
- Self-documenting test names in plain English

### Execution Quality
- All tests must run without errors
- Tests must fail with NotYetImplemented before implementation
- All tests must pass after implementation
- No console.log statements or debug code

## Success Criteria

- 15-20 behavioral tests created
- All tests follow behavior-driven format
- No mock-based verification
- All REQ tags covered with direct requirement validation
- Tests fail with NotYetImplemented before implementation
- No reverse tests (testing for failures)
- No structural tests (testing object structure only)
- All tests directly linked to PRD requirements
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- All tests compile with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors
