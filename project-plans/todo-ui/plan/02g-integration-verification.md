# Todo Integration Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the TodoDisplay component is properly integrated with the existing application:

1. TodoDisplay renders in the correct location
2. Conditional rendering works properly
3. Markdown output properly suppressed in interactive mode
4. Integration with existing UI components works
5. Follows clean code practices

## Verification Steps

### 1. App Integration Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoProvider is added to App.tsx
grep -q "TodoProvider" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: TodoProvider integrated in App.tsx" || echo "FAIL: TodoProvider not found in App.tsx"

# Check that TodoDisplay is included in render tree
grep -q "TodoDisplay" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: TodoDisplay included in App.tsx" || echo "FAIL: TodoDisplay not found in App.tsx"
```

### 2. Conditional Rendering Verification

```bash
# Check conditional rendering logic
grep -q "todos.*length\|TodoContext.*todos" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "PASS: Conditional rendering logic exists" || echo "WARNING: Conditional rendering logic missing"

# Manual verification of conditional rendering
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Test that TodoDisplay only renders when TODOs exist"
```

### 3. TodoWrite Output Control Verification

```bash
# Check that TodoWrite suppresses output in interactive mode
grep -q "interactiveMode.*suppress\|suppress.*interactiveMode" packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts && \
  echo "PASS: Output suppression in interactive mode" || echo "WARNING: Output suppression not found"

# Check that markdown still works in non-interactive mode
grep -q "non.*interactive\|interactive.*false" packages/core/src/tools/todo-write.ts && \
  echo "PASS: Non-interactive mode output exists" || echo "WARNING: Non-interactive output not found"
```

### 4. Styling and Layout Verification

```bash
# Check integration with existing styling
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check that TodoDisplay styling matches existing UI"

# Check layout and spacing
echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check proper spacing and layout in terminal"
```

### 5. TypeScript and Linting Verification

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode for App.tsx modifications
npx tsc --noEmit --strict packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx

# Check for absence of comments (self-documenting code)
grep -E "^\s*//" packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx && \
  echo "WARNING: Comments found in code" || echo "PASS: No comments in code"
```

## Success Criteria

- Conditional rendering works based on TODO data
- Markdown output properly suppressed in interactive mode
- Integration with existing UI components works
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- All code compiles with TypeScript strict mode
