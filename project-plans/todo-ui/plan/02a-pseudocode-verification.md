# Todo UI Enhancement Pseudocode Verification

## Verification Goals

Verify that the pseudocode was created correctly according to the PLAN.md guidelines:

1. Pseudocode covers all requirements from specification
2. No actual implementation code is included
3. Clear algorithm documentation is provided
4. All error paths are defined
5. Function signatures with types are included
6. Data transformations are documented

## Verification Steps

### 1. Requirement Coverage Verification

```bash
# Extract REQ tags from specification
SPEC_REQS=$(grep -o "REQ-[0-9.]*" project-plans/todo-ui/specification.md | sort -u)

# Check that pseudocode addresses requirements
for req in $SPEC_REQS; do
  # Check if requirement is addressed in any pseudocode file
  FOUND=false
  for file in project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/*.md; do
    if grep -q "$req" "$file"; then
      FOUND=true
      break
    fi
  done
  
  if [ "$FOUND" = false ]; then
    echo "MISSING: REQ tag $req not addressed in pseudocode"
  fi
done
```

### 2. Implementation Code Verification

```bash
# Check that pseudocode contains no actual implementation code
# Look for TypeScript/JavaScript syntax, actual code patterns
for file in project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/*.md; do
  # Check for code block patterns that might indicate real code
  grep -E "^.*function.*\(.*\).*\{" "$file" && \
    echo "WARNING: Possible implementation code in $file"
    
  grep -E "^[[:space:]]*(const|let|var).*=" "$file" && \
    echo "WARNING: Possible implementation code in $file"
    
  grep -E "^[[:space:]]*return[[:space:]]+" "$file" && \
    echo "WARNING: Possible implementation code in $file"
done

echo "MANUAL VERIFICATION: Check pseudocode files for actual implementation code"
