# Todo UI Integration Testing Plan

## Overview

Create integration tests to verify that all components work together correctly in both interactive and non-interactive modes. These tests will validate the complete flow from TodoWrite through TodoStore to TodoDisplay.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing tests, review the following documents:
- `project-plans/todo-ui/specification.md` - Feature specification with requirements
- All implementation plans (03-09) for understanding component behavior
- All pseudocode documents in `project-plans/todo-ui/analysis/pseudocode/`
- `docs/RULES.md` - Development guidelines for clean code practices

## Implementation Requirements

1. Test complete flow in interactive mode
2. Test complete flow in non-interactive mode
3. Verify data consistency throughout the system
4. Test error conditions and edge cases
5. Validate performance requirements
6. Follow clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
7. Use TypeScript strict mode
8. Work with immutable data only

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Interactive Mode Integration

1. Set up test with interactive mode context
2. Execute TodoWrite with sample data
3. Verify TodoStore contains correct data
4. Verify TodoDisplay renders correctly
5. Test with various data configurations

### 2. Non-Interactive Mode Integration

1. Set up test with non-interactive mode context
2. Execute TodoWrite with sample data
3. Verify correct Markdown output
4. Verify TodoStore contains correct data
5. Test with various data configurations

### 3. Data Consistency Testing

1. Write data with TodoWrite
2. Read data with TodoRead
3. Verify data consistency between write and read
4. Test with extended and simple data formats

### 4. Error Condition Testing

1. Test with invalid data
2. Test with storage failures
3. Test with rendering failures
4. Verify proper error handling

### 5. Performance Testing

1. Test with large todo lists (up to 50 tasks)
2. Measure update performance
3. Verify performance requirements are met

## Quality Assurance

### Test Quality
- All tests must follow behavioral testing principles
- No mock theater or implementation testing
- Each test transforms INPUT â†’ OUTPUT based on requirements
- Tests must have Behavior-Driven comments with @requirement tags

### Code Quality
- All test code must compile with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors or warnings
- Follow naming conventions from `docs/RULES.md`
- Self-documenting test names in plain English
- No comments in test code

### Execution Quality
- All tests must run without errors
- Tests must fail appropriately before implementation
- All tests must pass after implementation
- No console.log statements or debug code

## Success Criteria

- Complete flow works in interactive mode
- Complete flow works in non-interactive mode
- Data consistency maintained throughout system
- Proper error handling for all components
- Performance requirements met
- All integration tests pass
- Code follows clean code practices from `docs/RULES.md`
- All tests compile with TypeScript strict mode
- No linting errors
- Self-documenting test names
