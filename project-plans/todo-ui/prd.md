# Todo UI Enhancement - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the TODO list functionality in the LLXPRT CLI by replacing the current Markdown-based output with a dedicated UI component that provides a cleaner, more structured view of tasks, subtasks, and tool calls.

## 2. Product Overview
The enhanced TODO UI will provide users with a clear, hierarchical view of their task lists directly in the interactive CLI, making it easier to track progress on multi-step projects.

## 3. Stakeholders
- Primary users: Developers using the LLXPRT CLI
- Secondary users: LLM agents working with TODO lists

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core UI Requirements
[REQ-001] The system shall display TODO tasks in temporal order matching their stored sequence.

[REQ-002] The system shall use ASCII-only status markers for tasks:
- `- [x]` for completed tasks
- `- [ ]` for pending tasks
- `- [→]` for the current task

[REQ-003] The system shall highlight the current task by bolding its text and adding a "← current task" indicator.

[REQ-004] The system shall display subtasks indented with a bullet character (`•`).

[REQ-005] The system shall display tool calls nested under their respective subtasks with a right arrow character (`↳`).

[REQ-006] The system shall redraw the entire TODO display on each update rather than appending new content.

[REQ-007] The system shall use only ASCII characters in the display, with no emoji or special symbols.

[REQ-008] The system shall update the TODO display automatically whenever the TodoWrite tool is executed in interactive mode.

[REQ-009] The system shall display an appropriate message when the TODO list is empty.

### 4.2 Interactive Mode Requirements
[REQ-010] The system shall create a TodoDisplay React component at `packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx`.

[REQ-011] The system shall implement React state or context management for TODO data that triggers component re-renders.

[REQ-012] The TodoWrite tool shall suppress Markdown output in interactive mode, returning only a minimal ToolResult.

[REQ-013] The system shall associate tool calls with their respective subtasks in the data structure.

[REQ-014] The TodoDisplay component shall be integrated into the main app layout.

### 4.3 Non-Interactive Mode Requirements
[REQ-015] The system shall provide simplified output in non-interactive mode focused on essential information.

[REQ-016] The system shall continue returning Markdown format in non-interactive mode but in a simplified structure.

[REQ-017] The system shall maintain API compatibility for programmatic usage of the tools.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
[REQ-018] The system shall render the TODO display efficiently, with updates completing within 100ms for lists with up to 50 tasks.

[REQ-019] The system shall have minimal impact on overall CLI performance during TODO list operations.

### 5.2 Reliability
[REQ-020] The system shall gracefully handle TODO data retrieval errors without crashing the application.

[REQ-021] The system shall maintain UI consistency even during rapid TODO list updates.

[REQ-022] The system shall recover appropriately from edge cases and malformed TODO data.

### 5.3 Usability
[REQ-023] The system shall present a clean, uncluttered TODO display that is easy to read at a glance.

[REQ-024] The system shall maintain consistent visual appearance with the existing CLI theme and styling.

[REQ-025] The system shall function properly across different terminal sizes and environments.

## 6. Data Requirements

[REQ-026] The system shall extend the existing Todo schema to include optional subtasks and tool calls.

[REQ-027] The system shall maintain backward compatibility with existing TODO data storage.

[REQ-028] The system shall ensure proper serialization and deserialization of enhanced TODO data.

## 7. Testing Requirements

[REQ-029] The system shall include unit tests for the TodoDisplay component with various TODO configurations.

[REQ-030] The system shall include integration tests verifying that TodoWrite executions update the UI correctly.

[REQ-031] The system shall maintain or improve overall test coverage for the TODO functionality.

## 8. Implementation Constraints

[REQ-032] The system shall use the existing React/Ink UI framework in the CLI.

[REQ-033] The system shall follow existing code patterns and styling conventions in the codebase.

[REQ-034] The system shall maintain compatibility with the existing TodoStore for data persistence.

## 9. Success Criteria

[REQ-035] The TodoDisplay component shall correctly render all TODO configurations including tasks with subtasks and tool calls.

[REQ-036] Interactive mode shall display the enhanced UI instead of Markdown output from the TodoWrite tool.

[REQ-037] Non-interactive mode shall provide simplified TODO output.

[REQ-038] All existing tests shall pass, and new tests shall achieve at least 80% coverage of the new functionality.

[REQ-039] No performance degradation shall be observed in CLI operations during testing.
