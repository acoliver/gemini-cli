# Todo Tool Enhancement - Real-time Tool Call Display Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds real-time display of tool calls as subitems under active todos, with spinners for executing tool calls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Tool Call Tracking
- **ToolCallTrackerService**: Enhanced to track executing tool calls in memory
- **Executing Tool Call Management**: Start, complete, and fail tracking of tool calls
- **Subscription System**: UI components can subscribe to updates for real-time display

### 2. UI Integration
- **ToolCallContext**: React context for providing real-time tool call information to components
- **ToolCallProvider**: Provider component that manages tool call state and subscriptions
- **TodoDisplay Update**: Component now shows both executing (with spinners) and completed tool calls

### 3. Core Integration
- **CoreToolScheduler Update**: Tracks tool calls as they start executing
- **Status Management**: Properly handles completion and failure of executing tool calls

## Components Created/Modified

### Core Package
1. `packages/core/src/services/tool-call-tracker-service.ts`
   - Added real-time tracking of executing tool calls
   - Added subscription mechanism for UI updates
   - Added methods to start, complete, and fail tool call tracking

2. `packages/core/src/core/coreToolScheduler.ts`
   - Modified to track tool calls as they start executing
   - Integrated with ToolCallTrackerService for status updates

### CLI Package
1. `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/ToolCallContext.tsx`
   - Created React context for tool call information

2. `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/ToolCallProvider.tsx`
   - Created provider component to manage tool call state

3. `packages/cli/src/ui/components/TodoDisplay.tsx`
   - Updated to show executing tool calls with spinners
   - Updated to show completed tool calls
   - Integrated with ToolCallContext

4. `packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx`
   - Integrated ToolCallProvider into the application

### Tests
1. `packages/core/src/services/tool-call-tracker-service.test.ts`
   - Added tests for executing tool call tracking
   - Added tests for completion and failure handling

2. `packages/cli/src/ui/components/__tests__/TodoDisplay.test.tsx`
   - Updated tests to match new UI format
   - Added test for displaying executing tool calls with spinners

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Executing Tool Call Tracking**:
   - Tool calls are tracked in memory (not persisted) while executing
   - Each tool call gets a unique ID for tracking
   - UI components can subscribe to updates for real-time display

2. **Spinner Animation**:
   - Simple character-based spinner (|, /, -, \) for executing tool calls
   - Spinner updates as the component re-renders

3. **UI Integration**:
   - TodoDisplay now shows both executing and completed tool calls
   - Executing tool calls display with spinners
   - Completed tool calls display without spinners

4. **State Management**:
   - ToolCallProvider manages real-time tool call state
   - Context is used to pass tool call information to components
   - Proper cleanup of subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

## API Changes

### New Methods in ToolCallTrackerService
- `startTrackingToolCall()`: Starts tracking an executing tool call
- `completeToolCallTracking()`: Marks a tool call as completed
- `failToolCallTracking()`: Marks a tool call as failed
- `getExecutingToolCalls()`: Gets executing tool calls for a todo
- `subscribeToUpdates()`: Subscribes to tool call updates
- `getAllExecutingToolCalls()`: Gets all executing tool calls (for UI provider)
- `clearExecutingToolCallsForSession()`: Clears executing tool calls (for testing)

## Backward Compatibility

This implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing todo functionality continues to work unchanged
- Tool call persistence to todo items continues as before
- New real-time features are additive and don't break existing behavior

## Testing

All tests are passing:
- ToolCallTrackerService tests: 5/5 passed
- TodoDisplay tests: 21/21 passed
- Project builds successfully with no TypeScript errors

## Usage

1. When a todo is marked as "in_progress", it becomes the active todo
2. Tool calls executed while a todo is active are tracked in real-time
3. Executing tool calls appear in the todo list with spinners
4. Completed tool calls appear in the todo list without spinners
5. The UI updates automatically as tool calls execute, complete, or fail

This implementation provides a much better user experience for tracking task progress by showing tool calls directly in the context of the tasks they're associated with.
